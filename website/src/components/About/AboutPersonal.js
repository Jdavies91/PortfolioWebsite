In my spare time, I like to program, learn different languages, and strengthen my skills by learning new techniques.  When I am not doing that, I socialize with my partner, dog, friends, and play video games. 
Right now, I enjoy playing EA Sports NHL games,  EA Sports FIFA games, Call of Duty,  and Overwatch.  
I also enjoy playing some computer games, including World of Warcraft Classic and Diablo 3. I also love keeping up to date with live sports.  I keep up with every Vancouver sports team and the Seattle Seahawks. 
 My favorite sports memory was when I went to Game 7 of the Chicago Blackhawks and Vancouver Canucks playoff series when Burrows slayed the dragon.  I also try to go down once a year to watch the Seahawks, and when I am not down there, I am watching them on TV.
