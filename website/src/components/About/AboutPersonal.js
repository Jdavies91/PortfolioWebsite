What I like to do in my spare time is to program and learn different lanagues and techniques. 
To Strengthening my Skills.  When I am not doing that, I socialize with friends and play video games. 
 Right now, I am mostly playing games on the phone because my Xbox is out of commission. 
  The Xbox game I like to play EA Sports NHL games,  EA Sports Fifa games, Call of Duty,  and Overwatch.   
I also enjoy playing some computer games, including World of Warcraft Classic and Diablo 3. 
 I also love keeping up to date with live sports too.  I keep up with every Vancouver sports team and the Seattle Seahawks.  
 My favorite sports memory was when I went to Game 7 of the Chicago Blackhawks and Vancouver canucks when burrows slayed the dragon.  I also try to go down once a year to watch the Seattle Seahawks, and when I am not down there, I am watching it on the t.v every week.
