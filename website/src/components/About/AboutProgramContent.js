                The first language I ever learned was C++ in high school.  We learned some basic functionality like functions, variables, operators, and arrays. With this talent, we were able to create a game of our choosing.  I choose to make a Casino Based game.  This game had Like Blackjack, Craps, and Roulette(Very basic version).  The Casino Based game was the first game that I realized that I love programming.  I Later continued my programming career at Douglas college then furthered my knowledge at BCIT. 
                At Douglas, the primary focused Visual Basic with some java and beginner C++ that mostly concentrate on objects and pointers.  We ended doing a hotel reservation system where you were able to add rooms, rates, Reservations bookings, and payments.  You where also able to do cancelations and modifications if needed. I later decided to further my knowledge at BCIT.  Where I found I learned more Web Development and more programming Design Pattern and Polymorphism techniques.  
                Web development, we learned how to become a full-stack developer.  Which I found useful with the Memory game and the Knowledge Base website.
