            The first language I ever learned was C++ in high school.  We learned the basics:  functions, variables, operators, and arrays. With these skills, we were able to create a game of our choosing.  
            I choose to make a Casino game.  This game had Blackjack, Craps, and Roulette.  The Casino game was the first game that I developed, and I realized I love programming.  
            I continued my programming career at Douglas College.   At Douglas, the primary focus was Visual Basic with some Java and C++.  
            Fundamental techniques I learned included objects and pointers.  Our final project was a hotel reservation system where you were able to add rooms, rates, reservations, payments, cancelations, and make modifications.
             I was enjoying programming so much I decided to further my knowledge at BCIT, where I learned more Web Development and how to become a full-stack developer. 
             I found these new skills very helpful in developing websites that included a Memory game and a Knowledge Base website.  
              On the software side, we concentrated on more programming techniques like Design Pattern and Polymorphism.  </p>
